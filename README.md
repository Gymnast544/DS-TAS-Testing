# DS-TAS-Testing
TAS Files that I'm using with the Input Interface (console verification of DS TASes).

I used this code to console verify some TASes of New Super Mario Bros DS - see the playlist of individual levels here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTmu1NNRglA&list=PLu3fpUiWVZBQCO81hI32_TrBFMja92FG-

Since the DS load times don't match with those of Desmume console verification is a slow and arduous process.



I'm using a DS Input Interface (which I no longer sell but all the design files are public on my Github): https://www.tindie.com/products/gymnast544mods/ds-input-interface/
